These functions below are the HELPER FUNCTIONS. They are:

precentile: gives us percentile rankings based on scores on the exam.

produce_distplot: returns a distribution plot over a histogram based on the specific column
                  of the gradebook.

produce_hist: returns a histogram based on a specific column of the gradebook.

section_total: takes a DF, section_name, and the exam_str and adds a new column that is
               named '<section_name> Total'.

    the Overall Report.

These functions process the gradebook.

process_gradebook: processes the entire gradebook

process_single_report: process a single row of the gradebook, or process the overall report.

process_gradebook will call process_single_report, while also generating the percentile_dict
required to run process_single_report.

def process_gradebook(gradebook, student_keys, exam_str, path="./", admin_only = False):
    '''
    Main method of the report generator. Sets up a gradebook to be processed
    by the process_single_report function. By default will also generate an admin report.
    The reports are based on the exam_str, which is a dictionary as seen below:
    {"Example Exam" : ({"Section 1" : ({"Question 1" : ("Binary Search", 5),
                                        "Question 2" : ("Object Oriented", 10)}, 15)}, 15)}
    **NOTE: YOU CAN ALSO FIND A MORE INDEPTH GUIDE (AS WELL AS METHODS TO CREATE ONE IN
      ~/exam_wizard/structure_files/exam_structure_updater.ipynb)
    This dictonary needs to have matching names with the gradebook columns, as a mismatch will
    throw an error. This information will be stored in the exam_structure file, and should only
    be modified when the exam is updated.

    Inputs:
    gradebook: a gradebook of graded student exams.
    student_keys: key linkining submissions to the students real names
    exam_str: the structure of the exam in question
    admin_only: generate just the overall report

    Returns:
    gradebook: a gradebook of graded student exams, with aggregation columns
               (i.e., "Total Score"), as well as the names attached to the student
               IDs.
    It saves the files to a [FOLDER PATH] specified.
